57714 the first of hopefully many metallic atmospheres to kick off my "metal atmosphere project". i was inspired by the ingenious atmospheres used in the silent hill games (particularly silent hill 3) which are basically reverberant sounds of clanking, screeching, and scraping metal, dissonant drones, and chilling screams. anyway, backstory aside, this is the result of the inspiration...pretty much a carbon copy of the silent hill atmospheres but made from legal sounds hosted by freesound. :d  freesounds used:  dj chronos: suspense 001.wav, suspense 022.wav jenc: shpk.wav, latch1.wav, pang.wav 
106882 i was walking by the night club in belgrade, which is located in the basement of an old building, heard this, and decided to record it. the sound of the bass itself is unprocessed, muffled and very distorted because the sound energy caused bars and the ventilation system of the night club to resonate so very much. recorded with zoom h4n, which handled this very high sound pressure level in the bass range so good. please rate, comment and share. in case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing i ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. it would be a pleasure. please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. i really try to keep an open mind for everything. thank you. peace. matt

82542 complete sequence of getting into a car, starting and stopping and driving away and coming back again. includes footsteps on gravel, opening &amp; closing doors, ignition key, seatbelts, squeaky brake drum, tyres on light gravel etc. this recording and the other three "car_start_stop_source***" files are unedited recordings made as source material for the "car_arrive*" and "car_go*" sfx also posted here. mic'ed at about 2.5 metres the recordings have a natural ambience that i could not avoid at the time including birds, dog bark, distant vehicles etc. which had to be edited out of the final sfx takes. ambience is quite "lively" due to house and tall brick wall within about 4 metres. there are multiple takes on some door open/closing, engine revs etc., and random pauses between key sounds for a spread of editing options. recorded with sm57s and pioneer cd recorder through ancient home made custom balanced mic amp.

41566 this is the sound of a piece of a4 paper being cut with scissors. the paper was wedged between the capsules of a rode nt-4 stereo microphone and so was in contact with them. you can hear the beats as the slip-stick motion of the cut happened. could be useful for percussion...slice it up and see :) recording chain: rode nt4 (mic) - sound devices mixpre (mic preamp) - edirol r-09 (16 bit @ 44.1 khz)

41606 i was not happy with the actual shell casing form the pistol that my ex stepdad shot up the living room with and i have no spent ak shells so i set about looking for alternative sources of the "ejected shell hitting the street" sound. this is a hand cuff key, a suitcase key and a metal guitar pick.

82541 complete sequence of getting into a car, starting and stopping and driving away and coming back again. includes footsteps on gravel, opening &amp; closing doors, ignition key, seatbelts, squeaky brake drum, tyres on light gravel etc. this recording and the other three "car_start_stop_source***" files are unedited recordings made as source material for the "car_arrive*" and "car_go*" sfx also posted here. mic'ed at about 2.5 metres the recordings have a natural ambience that i could not avoid at the time including birds, dog bark, distant vehicles etc. which had to be edited out of the final sfx takes. ambience is quite "lively" due to house and tall brick wall within about 4 metres. there are multiple takes on some door open/closing, engine revs etc., and random pauses between key sounds for a spread of editing options. recorded with sm57s and pioneer cd recorder through ancient home made custom balanced mic amp.

99201 this is the recording of a bunch of amateur basketball players playing five on five in one of the basketball courts in my neighborhood. i hate this kind of reverberation, but maybe some of you will find it useful while synchronizing it to some kind of large indoor space. their speech is not very understandable and i myself can hardly understand every fifth word they are saying. anyway, these guys are talking in serbian, so you can synchronize this sound to some non-english speaking guys playing basketball, no one will notice. :) enjoy the game! recorded with zoom h4n. please rate, comment and share. in case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing i ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. it would be a pleasure. please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. i really try to keep an open mind for everything. thank you. peace. matt

50650 this is a remix of volivieri's "small_pipe_bang.wav". i cut out the third metallic ting sound from the recording and pitched it down 40 notes. i added a parametric eq and accented the upper and lower mid freq ranges to achieve an optimum metallic clank sound. i then added another eq that deals with more precise signal processing, and filtered out some unwanted high end sounds. i slapped on some fast decaying reverb and voila!   i was watching the silent hill movie today and i realized how much the sound designers relied on metallic textures to create a mechanical atmosphere so i hunted for some good clanky sounds that i could mess around with to mimic those sounds. thanks for the great sample volivieri, i'll be back for more no doubt!

165290 this is me playing around with my various string instruments. i decided to try to create a creepy string texture-ish sound, but it came out sounding like a haunted string orchestra. i hope you like it. i used a foot-long violin, a full-sized violin, a ukulele, and my father's home-made frettless banjo-thing.
165439 this sound was created with the technique invented and developed in my phd, called histogram mapping synthesis (hms). hms is based on cellular automata (ca) which are mathematical/computational models that create moving images. in the context of hms, these images are analysed by histogram measurements, giving as a result a sequence of histograms. in a nutshell, these histogram sequences are converted into spectrograms which in turn are rendered into sounds. additional dsp methods were developed to control the ca and the synthesis so as to be able to design and produce sounds in a predictable and controllable manner.    for further reading, see: <a href="http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/publications/11_serquera.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/publications/11_serquera.pdf</a>

34371 this is a lanz bulldog tractor engine about 77 years old. it is a one cylinder two stroke machine, 10200 ccm swept volume, 19 hp. the pistons mass is 35 kg. this machine is started with a blowlamp. it was recorded  with 2 mbho mbc603 + ka100, rme quadmic and archos gmini 402. the machine was recorded inside of a hall.
34275 processed a breakbeat with dblue glitch then followed by a full rack of effects, ranging from distortions , eqs, reverb, phaser... think thats all.
34340 my first sound contribution combines segments of 26723_leady_worried_breathing_reverb.wav (1.258 secs from 5.884, de-amplified and sped up) along with 8, 9 and 20 of 748_adcbicycle_ding_hits.zip pack (also with negative amplification and -9db gain) layered aside another track of 14609_man_swosh.aif (only the second and third with the form of three reversed, and again, highly un-amplified.. lowly amplified? oh yeah, also used the wahwah plugin for audacity on this one)  i made this for a project i'm doing in which i need a very short clip (3-7 seconds) of a genderless person (either man or woman) working out on a home fitness machine.  this file here is the result of my efforts toward that goal but is actually 28 seconds long and it's built appropriately so as to be loopable.   this will work for me and i hope it's as useful for somebody else.
27568 this is part of a soundesign work for the new memorymoon vsti that emulate the legendary memory moog synthesizer! released after 15 moths of development by gunnar ekornås, already known for the amazing work on the arppe2600va and minimogue as member of voltkitchen crew.  the pack consist in a small selection of patches from a new bank of presets called "moon mobile bank", that will be available as factory presets in the next update ..so take it just like a little tease.  the sound is a nice one shot spaced blast effect. onboard effects, no additional processing.
165478 a little gun battle that i made using a bunch of freesound noises.  you get a better quality of sound if you have the right speakers, but pretty epic either way.

31970 recording of the power supply fan and the cpu fan of my old gateway computer (currently my sound studio) through the slot where my cd drive should go... i recorded this sample with a telex/boston mic (not a good buy by the way) with a small cloth bag over the mic head to muffle the high freq noises. i ran the recording through audacity and cut it up and then passed it through a 31 band eq vst plugin in fl studios 3 and i removed the high freq sounds and boosted the mid tones.   this sample is intended for willy313 to be used in his upcoming computer game "sub zero conditions: 2" as the loop for either a robot or the ambient sounds for the game levels, but use it if you like it.

101237 i smuggled my recorder into belgrade courthouse, stood in the lobby, and recorded the atmosphere while the security guards weren't watching. basically, taking photos in this building is not allowed, but as long as i have seen, it did not say anything about sound recording. anyhow, i used the time when the security guards were not watching, went in one of the corners of the big hall and recorded this ambience. it is kinda cool, you can hear crowd of about 50 to 80 people being kinda nervous, coughing, laughing and the sounds of all kinds of important papers being officially stamped. the lobbies in our courthouses are usually a place which looks like a post office, something like an administrative part of the courthouse. recorded with zoom h4n. please rate, comment and share. in case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing i ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. it would be a pleasure. please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. i really try to keep an open mind for everything. thank you. peace. matt

101246 a sound of an 50 year old metal brandy glass being hit with the other metal glass, exactly the same as the first one, since they belong to the same set. i found this to be very cool and interesting sound with a whole lotta harmonics, overtones, hidden sounds which i just love, by listening to it closely over and over again, especially after the initial hit, when the sound starts to get more and more quiet. recorded with zoom h4n. please rate, comment and share. in case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing i ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. it would be a pleasure. please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. i really try to keep an open mind for everything. thank you. peace. matt
101278 this is the sound of a big giant air pump inflating some stupid huge tent intended for cocktails and what not. last year it was located near the place where river sava flows into the river danube. i suppose it was intended for snobby gatherings after the tennis matches that were held on the tennis courts just next to it. at least, i stole their sound. in my humble opinion, this sound is very applicable and versatile. you can use it as a sound of a space ship floating somewhere far in the galaxy, or as a sound of some super-humid boiler-room, or anywhere where the long droning low-pitched sound is needed, or as a build-up part of a scene in a horror movie, for example...or just make a trippy song out of it. just use it and enjoy it! recorded with zoom h4n. please rate, comment and share. in case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing i ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. it would be a pleasure. please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. i really try to keep an open mind for everything. thank you. peace. matt

101415 i was walking through an unknown part of the city near the river, through the neighborhood made out of slums, i have never seen before, in search of...something. sounds, i guess. it was 3 am. all of a sudden, a giant dog (i recognized it was a bullmastiff) started barking at me like crazy. i thought he was going to rip me apart, but the fence stopped him from doing that :) so, instead of playing with him i decided to share his angry barking with the world. the slums are very close to each other and the reverb is zero-to-none, which is cool for this sample in particular. enjoy! recorded with zoom h4n. please rate, comment and share. in case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing i ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. it would be a pleasure. please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. i really try to keep an open mind for everything. thank you. peace. matt

39135 after an idea by experimental illness (you rule your backyard when it glams to kitsch): i loaded quicktimealt.exe in wavelab, mangled it a bit more using dfx vst's scrubby and skidder, manipulated the file partially at clusterlevel and recovered it, stretched it from 80 to 10 bpm twice before offering it to you all in tasty mono format. delicious.

44522 this is the sound of a gasoline engine powered vacuum which is towed behind a dump truck and sucks up leaves.  it moves slowly, at a walking pace or even slower.  a man walks alongside the machine and sweeps leaves into the vacuum.  there are often twigs and sticks and other things being swept up, and they make sharp cracking sounds.  the truck passes from left to right in front of my microphones.  i have little of the approach, but the tailing off as the truck moves away fades off very smoothly and steadily.  two cars pass my position during this fade.  at the end, the men shut off the vacuum motor.  recorded using a micro-track portable with its standard "t" stereo mic.

18405 a quick piece i made using various effects, to give the impression of a factory accident in which a fire/explosion occurs, and steam vents and opened etc.    attribution information:    i'm afraid i threw that together 7 years ago when i would have been 14 years old. i can't really remember whether i used any other sounds to make it, or if i generated it (and definitely can't remember who needs attributed if sounds  were used). if you recognise any of your work in this - just give me a shout/report it; i've got no problem removing this, as i said; did it a long time ago and forgot i'd even made it.    so just be aware there are risks in using this and you'd probably be better just making a new better one to replace this anyway.    thanks!

101740 this is an engine sound i made several years before i knew about the freesound project.it is a little loud at some parts, and a flanger is present to show the flight of the machine.don't ask how i generated it, because i cannot remember.for those of you pro sound designers, you will find out very quickly how i generated it.a bit of landing of the machine is present, but not the impact on the ground.this is also good for a dragster sound, and or monster truck, whatever you want to do with it, it's flexable!can be used for just about anything, but mainly for fiction.for example, a light compact spacecraft.video game builders, this is a must in your sound library.you cannot be without this one...

94917 recently i have found a new vst effect: bit test by shuriken. you can download it from <a href="http://www.shuriken.se/the" rel="nofollow">http://www.shuriken.se/the</a> vst is donationware, so if you find it useful you should donate.this is a bit crusher with special features i have never seen elsewhere: the audio is converted to 8 bit, and then you can invert bits or switch them off. the effect of that is to severely distort your audio.as these samples demonstrate, it works great with guitar sounds before an amp + cabinet sim (like if it was a distortion pedal).on this sample, a guitar vst sound is put through a couple of compressors to boost and even out the signal. then it was fed to a vst guitar amp and cabinet simulator.

25243 this is part of a sound kit i've done in 2002 during a session testing deconstructor from tobybear, the basic version was a simple drum-loop, sliced and processed with pitchshifting, panning, tremolo, delay, reverb, vocoder.. and all those cool onboard fx tweaking here and there the original sound was completely mangled.. i saved the work in 2 folders: 'deconstruction-set' contain the longer slices (meant to be used with a sampler), 'deconstruction-kit' collects the smallest slices (to be used in a drum machine)

6576 this sample is part of the "steampipe multisample 1 mechanical" sample  pack. it is a multisample to import into your favourite samples. the  sample is a sound that in the lower frequencies could be coming from  some kind of a machine. in the higher frequencies, the sound deviates  more and more from the industrial character and becomes thinner. in the  sample pack there are 16 samples evenly spread across 5 octaves (c1  till c6). the note in the sample name (c, e or g#) does not indicate  the pitch of the sound but the key on my keyboard. the sound was  created with the steampipe v3 ensemble from the user library of reaktor. after that normalising and fades were applied within cubase sx &amp; wavelab.

(i recorded this for use in a theatrical play i was working on [ daddy's dyin'... who's got the will? ] because i couldn't find anything suitable elsewhere.)

47006 a machine like synthesiser sound.
103333 today i stumbled upon some cool road-workers, who were repairing the street. one of them was welding a piece of metal and i was like 'ok, this is something i gotta record and share with the world!' i went to the supermarket, bought a giant bottle of ice cold beer, returned to the place where they were working and i was like 'yo, guys, wanna trade a beer for some of your sounds?' since they are the coolest people in the world, they agreed. they let me record for about 10 minutes, even though they were very, very busy. thank you, guys! bad thing is that everything was happening in a very noisy street and had to process and edit the sounds, merge, filter, compress them and what not. in the end, i made it, and voila! in my humble opinion this is very applicable sound, even for something that has to do with science fiction, or as a possible build up in a horror visual piece or just put it in your visual as a sound of a vinyl record before the song is supposed to start. enjoy, my dear fellow sound-lovers! recorded with zoom h4n. please rate, comment and share. in case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing i ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. it would be a pleasure. please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. i really try to keep an open mind for everything. thank you. peace. matt

54414 still from a phone conversation, but this one sounds like a dart hitting a dartboard. it is in c, although it is so short it really doesn't matter.
54413 although still labled as a "phone bump" this one sounds a little bit more like a snippet of human speech. it is in e, and is to brief to be intelligible at all.
54412 a small bump in an answering machine message, it is in g, and is incredibly short. 
54411 a small bump in an answering machine message, it is in f#, and is incredibly short. 
54410 a small bump in an answering machine message, it is in d, and is incredibly short. 
54407 i took this sample from a phone message. i did use a live feed,(from the headset output on my phone, through a cable into my digital recorder.) but it is very soft. when i tried recording with out the live feed, i couldn't even find the noise again. it could definitely use to be amped up a bit.
54404 recording taken from a train at about 20 feet away. it was very windy, so consequently, the majority of the track was very much ruined. there is a small click near half-way, caused by a brief release of steam. it might prove annoying if you are planning on looping it. there is also not an even right/left balance throughout, due to my movement to avoid the wind.

87409 07 january 2010 - at the request of 1badcapri, djkenry, and bersaelor - using my own voice humming at the pitch of the effect, and then putting eq, vocal transformer, chorus, pitch and reverb on it, i mocked up this effort to reproduce the cylon robot "sweeping" sound from battlestar galactica.  it should loop well with some judicious trimmage.    the result isn't an exact match, but i think i've captured the essence of it.  enjoy!  :)  recorded with shure beta 58a, m-audio firewire 410 sound card and 13 inch macbook with logic pro 8 and edited with garageband.

58353 used intensively in the final chapter of "ambienta" soundtrack! i'm proud enough of this sound that i have tried to design and re-produce for along time till obtaining a satisfactory result (i realized the square waveform was the key!!). it's a classic moog sweep you can ear in many many oldschool and contemporary tunes (lcd soundsystem "disco infiltrator"; luke vibert "homewerks"; beck "medley of vultures" ..just to make a few examples). sound was bounced as a long sweep, then sliced as 6 separate perfectly loopable files to fit better mixes of different tempos: first 2 files is pitching up, pt 2 and 3 are pitching down, last 2 files are 2 tails pitching down. hope you will enjoy and make some good use (if you do, please let me ear ;)

6581 this sample is part of the "steampipe multisample 1 mechanical" sample  pack. it is a multisample to import into your favourite samples. the  sample is a sound that in the lower frequencies could be coming from  some kind of a machine. in the higher frequencies, the sound deviates  more and more from the industrial character and becomes thinner. in the  sample pack there are 16 samples evenly spread across 5 octaves (c1  till c6). the note in the sample name (c, e or g#) does not indicate  the pitch of the sound but the key on my keyboard. the sound was  created with the steampipe v3 ensemble from the user library of reaktor. after that normalising and fades were applied within cubase sx &amp; wavelab.

64424 this is part of a series of experimental synthesized tracks i created using a korg kaoss pad. performed and recorded in a single, real-time situation and presented here with no added post-production.   the kaoss pad lets you control the effect entirely from the touch-pad in realtime. different effect parameters are assigned to the x-axis and y-axis of the touch-pad and can be controlled simultaneously, meaning that you can vary the delay time and the feedback at the same time, or simultaneously change the cutoff and resonance of a filter. this means that complex effect operations that otherwise would require two hands on a conventional knob-based controller can be performed easily and intuitively with just one hand. it’s also easy to apply complex effects by rubbing or tapping the pad with your fingertip as though you were playing a musical instrument.

146928 part of the continuum (the never ending collaboration project).    this sample is a remix of:  <a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/thatjeffcarter/sounds/146338/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freesound.org/people/thatjeffcarter/sounds/146338/</a>    took snippets of this sample and pitched them up/down or re-pitched them (i.e., sample stretching). applied various types of delay and reverb.    applied eq, to isolate mid or high frequencies in certain snippets.  most of the metallic like sounds were the result of sample stretching and or spectral processing to warp the frequency contents of the sounds (i.e., invert the frequency contents of the sample: high frequencies become low frequencies and vice-versa).    the resulting sound clip is about 50s long and makes me think of an evil machine that has devoured all the resources in a planet to produce an army of horrendous and ferocious cyborgs.

102549 this is a typical sound of people waiting to buy tickets at the huge lobby of train station in belgrade, serbia. you can hear a group of about 50 people in one place and after that you can hear the pa announcer announcing the departure of the next train to novi sad, serbia. very cool moment. especially the vibe of the old and gritty sound of the station pa system that has been there since like forever. i think they haven't modernized it last 50 years, and that's the reason it sounds so cool, in my humble opinion. recorded with zoom h4n. please rate, comment and share. in case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing i ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. it would be a pleasure. please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. i really try to keep an open mind for everything. thank you. peace. matt

58350 used intensively in the final chapter of "ambienta" soundtrack! i'm proud enough of this sound that i have tried to design and re-produce for along time till obtaining a satisfactory result (i realized the square waveform was the key!!). it's a classic moog sweep you can ear in many many oldschool and contemporary tunes (lcd soundsystem "disco infiltrator"; luke vibert "homewerks"; beck "medley of vultures" ..just to make a few examples). sound was bounced as a long sweep, then sliced as 6 separate perfectly loopable files to fit better mixes of different tempos: first 2 files is pitching up, pt 2 and 3 are pitching down, last 2 files are 2 tails pitching down. hope you will enjoy and make some good use (if you do, please let me ear ;)

42191 faucet in a metal sink turned on and off.  hands are run through the water to simulate hand washing.  recorded in a tokyo apartment with a coincidental mic pair placed at a 90 degree angles  it's basically a raw recording, but i ran an ssl hpf with the cutoff set at about 28 hz to take out the rumble of the train passing by... since the apartment was near the station, the train sound was unavoidable.  but if this is used in a larger mix, it probably won't be noticeable.

78901 the first of a new sample pack hot out of the oven. these samples were created yesterday, 05-sep-2009.recently i have taken interest in amp modelling (simulating guitar amps) through vst plug ins.for anyone interesting can load up the great free guitar amps from:<a href="http://www.acmebargig.com/and" rel="nofollow">http://www.acmebargig.com/and</a> also boogex from voxengo, which is also free:<a href="http://www.voxengo.com/product/boogex/anyway..." rel="nofollow">http://www.voxengo.com/product/boogex/anyway...</a> the samples in this sample pack deal with an interesting glitch effect i found on the 6505 and 6505+ amp models on another piece of software: revalver.in these amp models there is a slight noise as the sound dies out (you may need to sample the output and amplify it on a sample editor to notice it).that is precisely what i did to create this sample.this appears at the tail of any sound, after the sound input to the amp has died out. i suspect this would not show up if i was feeding the amp with an actual guitar sound due to the small level of in-line noise. but i was feeding the amp with a short drum sample just to create this glitch effect.i used a reverse gate in ableton live to cut out the main part of the sound (the drum sample) which would be too loud and increased the gain so the tail sound was clearly audible.

94918 recently i have found a new vst effect: bit test by shuriken. you can download it from <a href="http://www.shuriken.se/the" rel="nofollow">http://www.shuriken.se/the</a> vst is donationware, so if you find it useful you should donate.this is a bit crusher with special features i have never seen elsewhere: the audio is converted to 8 bit, and then you can invert bits or switch them off. the effect of that is to severely distort your audio.as these samples demonstrate, it works great with guitar sounds before an amp + cabinet sim (like if it was a distortion pedal).on this sample, a guitar vst sound is put through a couple of compressors to boost and even out the signal. then it was put through bit test with some bits switched off before it was fed to a vst guitar amp and cabinet simulator.
