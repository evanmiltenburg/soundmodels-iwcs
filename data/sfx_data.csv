Recorded with Zoom H4n, which handled this very high sound pressure level in the bass range so good. Please rate, comment and share. In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure.

i saved the work in 2 folders: 'deconstruction-set' contain the longer slices (meant to be used with a sampler), 'deconstruction-kit' collects the smallest slices (to be used in a drum machine)

4.3,16,1411,2,"This sample is part of the ""SteamPipe Multisample 1 Mechanical"" sample
pack. It is a multisample to import into your favourite samples. The
sample is a sound that in the lower frequencies could be coming from
some kind of a machine. In the higher frequencies, the sound deviates
more and more from the industrial character and becomes thinner. In the
sample pack there are 16 samples evenly spread across 5 octaves (C1
till C6). The note in the sample name (C, E or G#) does not indicate

4.12820512820513,16,1411,2,"This is a remix of volivieri's ""small_pipe_bang.wav"".
I cut out the third metallic ting sound from the recording and pitched it down 40 notes. I added a Parametric EQ and accented the upper and lower mid freq ranges to achieve an optimum metallic clank sound. I then added another EQ that deals with more precise signal processing, and filtered out some unwanted high end sounds. I slapped on some fast decaying reverb and voila! 

I was watching the Silent Hill movie today and I realized how much the sound designers relied on metallic textures to create a mechanical atmosphere so I hunted for some good clanky sounds that I could mess around with to mimic those sounds. Thanks for the great sample volivieri, I'll be back for more no doubt!

HMS is based on Cellular Automata (CA) which are mathematical/computational models that create moving images. In the context of HMS, these images are analysed by histogram measurements, giving as a result a sequence of histograms. In a nutshell, these histogram sequences are converted into spectrograms which in turn are rendered into sounds. Additional DSP methods were developed to control the CA and the synthesis so as to be able to design and produce sounds in a predictable and controllable manner.

It took me so long to edit out all the unnecessary external sounds, but I think it was worth it. From time to time, as the sound progresses, you can hear the singing of a big parrot that was in the cage next to the little parrots I was recording. That other parrot is quite big and I think they call him 'Patagonian Parrot' (Latin name: Cyanoliseus Patagonus) Here you go, enjoy! Recorded with Zoom H4n. Please rate, comment and share.

4.18421052631579,16,1536,2,"I smuggled my recorder into Belgrade courthouse, stood in the lobby, and recorded the atmosphere while the security guards weren't watching. Basically, taking photos in this building is not allowed, but as long as I have seen, it did not say anything about sound recording. Anyhow, I used the time when the security guards were not watching, went in one of the corners of the big hall and recorded this ambience. It is kinda cool, you can hear crowd of about 50 to 80 people being kinda nervous, coughing, laughing and the sounds of all kinds of important papers being officially stamped. The lobbies in our courthouses are usually a place which looks like a post office, something like an administrative part of the courthouse. Recorded with Zoom H4n. Please rate, comment and share. In case you download some of my sounds and use them in your audiovisual artwork, the only thing I ask from you is to let me know where and how they ended up. It would be a pleasure. Please feel free to send me a private message if you have any questions or suggestions. I really try to keep an open mind for everything. Thank you. Peace.

I recorded this sample today, 10-11-2012 in LA, CA, USA.

I needed a radio tuning sample and I wasn't pleased with the ones I found, so I recorded one with my Zoom H2!

I realized I actually didn't have a radio, so I went to a thrift store and bought one for $4.34.
It sounds perfect for what I need.

This sample is in 44.1khz, 24bit.

Enjoy, comment, and download!

Attribution Information:

I'm afraid I threw that together 7 years ago when I would have been 14 years old. I can't really remember whether I used any other sounds to make it, or if I generated it (and definitely can't remember who needs attributed if sounds
were used). If you recognise any of your work in this - just give me a shout/report it; I've got no problem removing this, as I said; did it a long time ago and forgot I'd even made it.

So just be aware there are risks in using this and you'd probably be better just making a new better one to replace this anyway.

4.364583333333335,16,1536,2,"Today I stumbled upon some cool road-workers, who were repairing the street. One of them was welding a piece of metal and I was like 'ok, this is something I gotta record and share with the world!' I went to the supermarket, bought a giant bottle of ice cold beer, returned to the place where they were working and I was like 'Yo, guys, wanna trade a beer for some of your sounds?' Since they are the coolest people in the world, they agreed. They let me record for about 10 minutes, even though they were very, very busy. Thank you, guys! Bad thing is that everything was happening in a very noisy street and had to process and edit the sounds, merge, filter, compress them and what not. In the end, I made it, and voila! In my humble opinion this is very applicable sound, even for something that has to do with science fiction, or as a possible build up in a horror visual piece or just put it in your visual as a sound of a vinyl record before the song is supposed to start.

3.714285714285715,16,706,1,"07 January 2010 - At the request of 1badcapri, djkenry, and Bersaelor - Using my own voice humming at the pitch of the effect, and then putting EQ, vocal transformer, chorus, pitch and reverb on it, I mocked up this effort to reproduce the Cylon robot ""sweeping"" sound from Battlestar Galactica.  It should loop well with some judicious trimmage.  

The result isn't an exact match, but I think I've captured the essence of it.  Enjoy!  :)

A friend of mine owns a shop in which he sells antique telephones.  He and his assistant were incredibly gracious, they turned off the shop music, turned off their shop phone, connected up the antique phone, stayed fairly quiet, and even rang their own number for me whilst generously allowing me to record the sound of the phone ringing.  That was especially amazing because the phone was on special offer for £235.00 (retail price £299), so I didn't even have to buy the phone to get the sound of the ringer.

These samples were created yesterday, 05-Sep-2009.Recently I have taken interest in amp modelling (simulating guitar amps) through VST plug ins.For anyone interesting can load up the great free guitar amps from:<a href=""http://www.acmebargig.com/and"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acmebargig.com/and</a> also Boogex from voxengo, which is also free:<a href=""http://www.voxengo.com/product/boogex/Anyway..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voxengo.com/product/boogex/Anyway...</a> the samples in this sample pack deal with an interesting glitch effect I found on the 6505 and 6505+ amp models on another piece of software: Revalver.In these amp models there is a slight noise as the sound dies out (you may need to sample the output and amplify it on a sample editor to notice it).That is precisely what I did to create this sample.This appears at the tail of any sound, after the sound input to the amp has died out. I suspect this would not show up if I was feeding the amp with an actual guitar sound due to the small level of in-line noise. But I was feeding the amp with a short drum sample just to create this glitch effect.I used a reverse gate in Ableton Live to cut out the main part of the sound (the drum sample) which would be too loud and increased the gain so the tail sound was clearly audible.",2.66022675737,78901,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,6505 raw tail.wav,3,https://www.freesound.org/data/previews/78/78901_97763-hq.mp3,https://www.freesound.org/data/previews/78/78901_97763-hq.ogg,44100.0,amp-modelling amp-simulation crisp digital electronic noise glitch,wav,https://www.freesound.org/people/AlienXXX/sounds/78901/,AlienXXX
